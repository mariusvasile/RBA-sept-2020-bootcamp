# RBA September Bootcamp Coding Challenge

## Instructions for the Coding Challenge

This coding challenge will be split into multiple objectives. Some of the objectives will be mandatory, whilst others will be bonus ones!

### Mandatory steps

- create feature branch with the following naming convention 'feature/your_name' & start making changes in your own branch
- update **your** role in the table
- change the order of the columns to be: ID, NAME, EMAIL, ROLE
- align title in the center and have the following font: arial, sans-serif
- align table content to the center, have the following font: "Trebuchet MS", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; have a solid border, make it displayable on all of the screen

### Bonus steps:

- add more tests around the content of the table
- style row header to have the background colour of green, font color of white and consistent padding
- implement function sort the table names alphabetically
- write test for sort function

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test` or `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build` or `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
